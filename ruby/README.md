## Extract InfoWorks WS Pro Model to GeoJson
The script included in this directory converts a simulation in InfoWorks WS Pro into a GeoJSON file which can be opened with compatible GIS software or with the Model View application.


## Using the script
1. [Download the script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modelcreate/model-calibrate/master/ruby/modelcalibrate_export_to_geojson.rb)
2. Open a simulation in InfoWorks WS Pro
3. With the geoplan open run the script by going to Network > Run Ruby Script
4. Choose a location and filename for the GeoJSON file
5. The script runs between 1 minute to 10 minutes, based on the size of your network

## Known issues/limitations
* Currently only tested with IW Pro 3.5, it may not work on older versions
* Will only extract simulation results, you can not use it on a network directly
* Which fields get extracted are currently hard-coded within the ruby script
